/**
 *  The <tt>WeightedQuickUnionUF</tt> class represents a union-find data structure.
 *  It supports the <em>union</em> and <em>find</em> operations, along with
 *  methods for determining whether two objects are in the same component
 *  and the total number of components.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses weighted quick union by size (without path compression).
 *  Initializing a data structure with <em>N</em> objects takes linear time.
 *  Afterwards, <em>union</em>, <em>find</em>, and <em>connected</em> take
 *  logarithmic time (in the worst case) and <em>count</em> takes constant
 *  time.
 *  <p>
 *  For additional documentation, see <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/15uf">Section 1.5</a> of
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
