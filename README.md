This is a graphical percolation experiment which uses the union-find data structure.

To run, execute PercolationVisualizer, with any of the text files in the root directory (e.g. input50.txt) as the command-line argument. Alternatively, execute InteractivePercolationVisualizer, optionally with an integer N between 10 and 100 (inclusive) as  the command-line argument (if you don't, the default value for N is set to 10). This creates a N x N grid where the end-user can open individual cells by clicking / holding the mouse down.
